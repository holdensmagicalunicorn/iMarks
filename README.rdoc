= iMarks - Manage YOUR bookmarks in YOUR cloud.
* Setup the server anywhere you want, even at localhost or via DynDNS.
* Tags supported :).
* Use the chrome extension to search for bookmarks, update them or add new ones.
* For search "options" see http://github.com/dougal/acts_as_indexed



== Setup
* Tested on Ruby 1.8.7. I recommend Ruby Version Manager: http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/ 
* Requires ruby gems, 'bundler': http://gembundler.com/ and rails 3
* "gem install bundler" (only use sudo if you do not use RVM)
* "gem install rails" (only use sudo if you do not use RVM)
* "cd iMarks" go to your application's root directory
* you might need "bundle" to install required gems
* "rake db:migrate" to create database schema
* "rails s" to start the web server
* "open http://localhost:3000"
* For the chrome extension installation notes see "./_clients/README.rdoc"
* For now you may edit the iframe's src attribute to match it to the domain/IP you run iMarks server on.



== Known Bugs
* "name already taken" for some tag savings (for instance if you supply a (new) tag name twice on bookmark creation)



== Alpha TODO

=== Server
* Web based Auth (Devise?)
* Delete popup => jQuery fade in
* Creation redirect to index
* Add/Edit form styles
* Autoadd "^" to params search (stands for "starts with")
* Remove "^" from params-search if its the only char

=== Chrome Client
* Options: Set server IP
* Options: Set hotkey for saving



== 1.0 Beta TODO 

=== Server
* Aftersave: On HTTP/HTTPS read the documents title on a short timeout if user given title is empty
* Presistant search result on next open (cookie)
* Test and document Heroku deployment (for other users)

=== Chrome Client
* Presistant search result on next open + cookie storage (on next open of browser) (localstorage)
* Icon overhaul



== 1.1 TODO

== Server
* Large clickable backgrounds
* Hotkeys (arrows for the list, CMD/CTRL/META+S for saving)
* Test/Add Keyboard Navigation

=== Web Client
* Stylesheets for standard web browsers
* Stylesheets for iPhone/Android



== 2.0 TODO

=== Chrome Client
* Add clickable bookmark icon which reads http's/html <title> and applys this (optional) title to the bookmark. Copy chromes bookmark icon funcionality, add tags field.
* Option: disable Chromes internal bookmark star
* Autocompletion for tags
* Change icon depending on if the server is reachable
* Tags: Max 50 per Bookmark 
* Tags: Case in-sensitive "find", case sensitive create/update (e.g. "overwrite")

=== Server
* Tags: Plural/singluar in-sensitive "find", update to whatever is specified

* :-)



== Future thoughts and ideas?!
* Add optional description field
* Bookmark referencing bookmarks (like Also see: and Similiar:) (Bookmark HABTM Bookmark)
* Bookmark categories/collections (Like Tags)
* Tags: Inverted Search - Tag as the main model, Bookmarks as dependencies
* Tags: Manage tags - rename tags, merge togather tags
* AJAX navigation
